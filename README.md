# Vue Typewriter Component

This Vue component simulates a typewriter effect by typing and erasing sentences with customizable typing speed, delay, caret style, and looping options. The component is built with the [Vue 3 Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Demo Page
[https://dmncodes.github.io/vue-typing/](https://dmncodes.github.io/vue-typing/)


## Features

- **Dynamic Typing:** Type out a list of sentences with random typing speed within a specified range.
- **Erasing:** Erase sentences after typing, with configurable speed and delay.
- **Looping:** Option to loop through the sentences indefinitely.
- **Customizable Caret:** Customize the caret character and its appearance.
- **Event Emission:** Emits an event after typing each sentence, useful for triggering additional actions.

```css
.dmn-typing span.caret {
  color: inherit;
  animation: blink 1s infinite;
}

.dmn-typing span.typing {
  animation: none;
}

@keyframes blink {
  50% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

### 7. Testing
Unit tests are written using Vitest and Vue Test Utils. The tests cover:

* Typing the sentences correctly.
* Erasing sentences after typing.
* Emitting events after each sentence is typed.
* Correct application of the caret classes and animations.
